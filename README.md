# DeepLearning Projects and Kaggle Competitions

This repository consists of the projects that completed under the Competitive Programming with Deep Learning at HPI in Potsdam.

# Small Projects
* 1.) [😷  Classification](https://github.com/sefeoglu/DeepLearningProjectsandKaggleCompetitions/blob/master/SimpleMaskClassification.ipynb): classifies people with/whitout a mask.
* 2.) [Detection of pulmonary diseases in 🫁 ](https://github.com/sefeoglu/DeepLearningProjectsandKaggleCompetitions/blob/master/unet_with_fast_ai.ipynb): identifies the position of anomalies on the 🫁 by using UNET and segmentation.
* 3.) wip.
